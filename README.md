# DC resistivity forward modelling to determine detectability of fault offset: A case study on two sites in the Fraser Canyon
_Raul Benjamin Mendoza_

This is my repo for my project and assignment 4 of EOSC 556B

## Project Description
### Motivation
In August of 2024, my colleagues and I conducted DC resistivity surveys at two areas in the Fraser Canyon,
with the objective of finding offsets in the underlying material to determine the presence (or lack thereof)
of active faults. I have inverted the field data into resistivity models using AGIâ€™s EarthImager software. However, under
these specific conditions (i.e. the geology and the terrain) it is unclear to me what deformation from a
fault rupture would look like (or if it is even resolvable given the survey setup).
### Objectives
I intend to use discretize and SimPEG packages from the SimPEG ecosystem (Cockett et al., 2015) to
simulate data with and without layer offset related to faulting and see if the offset produces a detectable
signal in the inverted model.

## Installation instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create an environment using `conda env create -f project_environment.yml`.
3. Activate the environment using `conda env activate eosc556b_project`.
4. Open the _MainNotebook.ipynb_ notebook with Jupyter and you're good to go!

## Important components
1. The necessary packages are indicated in _environment.yml_ file.
2. _MainNotebook.ipynb_ contains the workflow while most of the operations are wrapped in functions in the _project_functions.py_ file.
3. The _fieldData_ folder contains the field data that will be used by MainNotebook.ipynb. You do not need to manually open anything from this folder.
