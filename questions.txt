Does simulation_res.dpred(resistivity_model) return the data in terms of normalized voltages or apparent resistivities? Is there
a default, or is it based on what the survey "data_type" is?

data_type when specified in the survey object creation informs SimPEG of what the dobs data is (i.e., either normalized voltage
or apparent resistivity). But, dpred will always be in normalized voltage. If you want to feed it back as dobs, you'll need
to use the apparent_resistivity_from_voltage function.
